## Hello, World! ðŸ‘‹ 

I'm Ronnie, a UK-based software engineer and technical architect with 10+ years of building cloud-native softwares, applications, tools, games, and automations for web, desktop, and mobile platforms. 

My primary technologies are C++, Python, and TypeScript. I'm particularly passionate about real-time graphics, game engine architecture, and secure software design. 

I also enjoy sharing my insights on software engineering, systems design, and the craft of building across various technology stacks.
