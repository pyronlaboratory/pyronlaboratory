## Hello, World! ðŸ‘‹ 

I'm Ronnie..

A dedicated, agile, and passionate, Fullstack Developer and Solutions Architect, with more than 6 years of hands-on experience in designing, developing, deploying, and maintaining scalable enterprise applications.

I specialize in implementing complicated architectural patterns on cloud platforms such as Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud Platform, and Firebase.

Although I'm primarily using Node.js and Python, I've established myself as a true polyglot.

My appetite for exploring the evolving trends in the industry has helped me to grow my toolbelt, which has a wide range of technologies including, but not limited to, Elasticsearch, Tensorflow, and 3D Graphics with WebGL and DirectX.

I often contribute to the community using various means. I've got a growing reputation on GitHub and StackOverflow, and so far my posts have been able to help more than 200k developers.

Throughout my previous roles, I have been actively involved in training and mentoring young engineers and post-graduates, guiding them to become industry-ready. 

I've independently developed and open-sourced a simple editor for rendering WebGL and WebXR graphics and creating immersive interactions, available at the public npm registry.

I hold the Arctic Code Vault Contributor badge for the 2020 GitHub Archive Program and I've also open source a build tool published at The Heroku Elements Marketplace. 

Levelling up as an engineer ðŸš€ every day with â˜• and ðŸ•’
