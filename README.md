### ðŸ‘‹ NAMASTE. BONJOUR. HOLA.


## I'm Ronnie.


I'm a fullstack web engineer with 5 years of experience in developing and maintaining enterprise applications.

I run a small tech hub on the west coast of India, from where I collaborate with clients remotely across the globe.

I work with Python, Git and Docker containers. All. Day. Long.

My appetite for exploring the evolving trends in the industry, has helped me to grow my toolbet, which has a wide range of technologies including, but not limited to, Amazon Web Services, Elasticsearch, Tensorflow and Reactive frontend with Angular/Typescript, Lighthouse, Workbox.

I follow PyCon and Google's opinionated reference for building amazing web experiences.

I often contribute back to the community using various means. I train and mentor young engineers as well as post graduates in becoming industry ready. I've a growing reputation on GitHub and StackOverflow.

Levelling up everyday with â˜• & ðŸ•’.
