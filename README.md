## Hello, World! ðŸ‘‹ 

I'm Ronnie, an aspiring game engineer hailing from the UK. 

### Simulation Portfolio â€”

*Adventures from simulated realms*

A curated collection of 3D graphics and gaming software developed during my pursuit of a Master's degree in Computer Science for Game Development.

## **Underwater Life Simulation**

A Direct3D 11 UWP app with procedurally generated visual effects for a sea life-based game. Implemented SM5 HLSL shaders to render objects using implicit and explicit geometry. Included realistic texturing, illumination, and animation for dynamic objects like sea bubbles and fish.

## **Rocket Launch Sequence**

Physical-based modelling and animation using DirectX 11 APIs to simulate the test firing of a rocket and the subsequent explosive and deformation that occurs when the rocket impacts the terrain.
